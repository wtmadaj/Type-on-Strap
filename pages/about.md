I've always loved the pure creation of web design and development. It's been a dream of mine to design and build websites - even if no one uses them. I just enjoy doing it, plain and simple.

This blog is meant to help explain and document projects as I work on them. My hope is that it will help other aspiring developers
achieve their goals too. 

I had to learn most of this on my own and still have tons yet to learn. So learn along with me for the new stuff, and I'll do my best to explain the stuff I already know.

Let's build some great sites.
