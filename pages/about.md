I've always loved the pure creation of web design and development. It's been a dream of mine to design and build websites - even if no one uses them.

This blog is meant to help explain and document projects as I work on them. My hope is that it will help other aspiring developers
achieve their goals too. 

I had to learn most of this on my own and still have miles to go. So learn along with me for the new stuff, and I'll do my best to explain the stuff I already know.

Let's build some great stuff.
