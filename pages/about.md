## What is this blog?
This blog's purpose is to help explain and document things as I work on them. One hope is that it will help other 
developers achieve their goals. Another is to keep feeding this passion of mine.

I call it a "blogumentary" to illustrate its purpose. Imagine a documentary crew following you around and capturing 
everything on video. It's like that, but replace the cameras with blog posts.

I learned most of this on my own and still have miles to go. So learn along with me for the new stuff, and I'll do my best to explain the stuff I already know.

Let's build some great stuff.


## Who am I?
I'm a Java software engineer by day, but my real passion is the pure creation web development. 

My dream is to design and build websites. To build and design whatever I choose. But dreams don't become reality without action. 
So this blog is the beginning.

Professional stuff aside, I'm a husband and a father to an amazing family. My life would be boring without them.

What if I'm not working on this passion or spending time with family? I love music, books, video games, woodworking, the cosmos,
deep thinking, funny stuff, movies... everything.
